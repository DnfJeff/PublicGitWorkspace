# Projects Overview

Welcome to my project repository! I work on a variety of technical projects with a focus on automation, file management, and game development. 
While each project is unique in its scope and goals, I strive to keep the code clean, efficient, and well-documented.

### Current Project: CSVmaker
The main file available in this repository is CSVmaker. This Python program is designed to scan a directory (and its subdirectories) for all files, capturing their full file paths and storing the data in a CSV file. It's ideal for organizing large collections of files such as pictures, videos, and other documents.

More details about CSVmaker can be found inside the CSVmaker folder in the specialized readme.
